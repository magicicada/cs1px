# Cycle 3 - Errors and Exceptions

Cycle 3 is about practicing different styles of dealing with errors and exceptions, and reminding ourselves about reading files (which you learned in CS1CT or similar).

In Cycle 3 we will also be practicing writing a larger piece of code that combines different functions to make a bigger product.  

Todo for this cycle:
- watch recorded videos on errors and exceptions
- work on lab exercises
- do quiz on Moodle
