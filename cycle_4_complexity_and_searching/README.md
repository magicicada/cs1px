# Cycle 5

Cycle 5 will change direction a bit from our previous topics - here we'll be looking at the idea of computational complexity that helps us formally describe the amount of time our code takes to run as a function of the size of the inputs.  

For those who would like other video resources about computational complexity:
- A good, detailed intro from a course at MIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZPTyGL2IQ
- A longer intro with more worked examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk

*If you have no trouble doing the lab exercises or are comfortable with the complexity questions we're talking about, then do not feel pressure to watch these videos.  They are just an extra resource.*

Todo for this cycle:
- Watch recorded videos 
- Work on lab exercises
- Discuss progress on lab at tutorial group
- Quiz on February 26th

Note that this cycle starts *before* reading week, but the labs, Q&A, and quiz are *after* reading week.
