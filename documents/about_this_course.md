# Welcome to CS1PX!  
This document should let you know generally what to expect from the course and how things will work.  


## What I want you to learn:
Overall, you should gain skill and confidence in your programming.  There are a few specific things that I really want you to be comfortable will because they will help open up more advanced computing science to you:
- simple data structures
- scope
- recursion
- complexity
- algorithms (via searching and sorting)
- error checking and exceptions
- using other people's code
- data structures with associated functions
- functional and object-oriented programming

I will try to design the lectures, labs, and assessments around these ideas.

I also want you to be excited about computing science, and have a chance to hear about some of the things that people work on in academia and industry.  I have a few recordings of people who work in computing talking about their work - if there's a field you'd like to hear from you are welcome to let me know and I'll try to find someone.  

## How it will work:

### Lectures:
I (Jess) will use Jupyter notebooks for most of the teaching so that I can interleave text and code.  It is important that you learn how to open and run Jupyter notebooks - I will show you how to do this in lecture.   Blair may also soemtimes use more conventional presentation tools.  

### Labs/tutorials:
Your tutorial groups will give you a chance to discuss your work on your weekly labs.  You can ask for help, or talk about what you've managed to do.  As with CS1CT, you will have demonstrator who will work with you in a small group and a tutor who will oversee several of these small groups. You should attend labs even if you have completed the lab material - but you can get the tutor to check your solution shortly after you arrive and then you need not stay if you don't want to.  We are obligated to take attendance at 1PX labs.  

### Quizzes:
Most weeks we will have short online quizzes to assess your knowledge of the previous cycle's material.  These will be run on Moodle, and will be available for a week.


### Assessed assignment:
You will work on an assessed assignment that is kind of like a small project.  This will be a piece of code that you should write and document yourself, and that you will hand in for grading.  Details will follow closer to the time. 

### End-of-course Exam:
We will have an end-of-course exam in the spring.  We will provide a revision checklist and an outline of the sorts of questions you should expect nearer the time.  


## Tools we will use:

I am planning to use a number of tools throughout this semester, including:
- Jupyter notebooks: (I run these via Anaconda of on Google's colab, but you are welcome to use any method you like.) 
- Moodle: all course information will be available on the Moodle page, some is also available on GitHub
- GitHub: I'll be maintaining a repo with notebooks and other materials for the course, but use this only if it is convenient for you.  Moodle will be the authoritative source.
- more may be added as we go 

For your labs and learning I suggest that you use Jupyter notebooks, either on a GlasgowAnywhere machine or on your own machine.  You can use IDLE if you would like to, but we won't be able to support you in installing the packages we'll need on your own machine for IDLE.


## The weekly schedule:
We have scheduled lecture sessions for two hours at noon on Wednesday, and you should have a lab slot assigned to you on Monday, or Tuesday.
