# Welcome to CS1PX!  
This document should let you know generally what to expect from the course and how things will work.  


## What I want you to learn:
Overall, you should gain skill and confidence in your programming.  There are a few specific things that I really want you to be comfortable will because they will help open up more advanced computing science to you:
- simple data structures
- scope
- recursion
- complexity
- algorithms (via searching and sorting)
- error checking and exceptions
- using other people's code
- data structures with associated functions

I will try to design the lectures, labs, and assessments around these ideas.

I also want you to be excited about computing science, and have a chance to hear about some of the things that people work on in academia and industry.  I have a few recordings of people who work in computing talking about their work - if there's a field you'd like to hear from you are welcome to let me know and I'll try to find someone.  

## How it will work:

### Lectures/Recordings:
I will use Jupyter notebooks for most of the teaching so that I can interleave text and code.  It is important that you learn how to open and run Jupyter notebooks - I will show you how to do this in lecture. 

### Labs/tutorials:
Your tutorial groups will give you a chance to discuss your work on your weekly labs.  You can ask for help, or talk about what you've managed to do.  As with CS1CT, you will have demonstrator who will work with you in a small group and a tutor who will oversee several of these small groups.  

### Quizzes:
Most weeks we will have short online quizzes to assess your knowledge of the previous cycle's material.  These will be run on Moodle, and will be available for the whole week of the lab sessions associated with the content.  


### Assessed assignment:
In the last couple of weeks of semester, you will work on an assessed assignment that is kind of like a small project.  This will be a piece of code that you should write and document yourself, and that you will hand in for grading.  Details will follow closer to the time, but to give you a general idea of what will be expected:  I will ask you to find a dataset that is publicly available somewhere, and write code to store and process this dataset, including some sort of simple analysis and visualisation.  I will give examples of what I am looking for later in the course, and will provide a clear list of the marking criteria so that you know what we will be looking for.  

### End-of-course Exam:
We will have an online end-of-course exam in the spring.  I will provide a revision checklist and an outline of the sorts of questions you should expect nearer the time.  


## Tools we will use:

I am planning to use a number of tools throughout this semester, including:
- Jupyter notebooks: (I run these via Anaconda, but you are welcome to use any method you like.  I will link a guide to using these in the first week.  I will also usually try to include Binder links for the notebooks so you can run them online if you like.)
- Recorded videos: these will mostly be me going through the notebooks I prepare
- slido: this will let you anonymously ask questions or make requests
- Moodle: all course information will be available on the Moodle page, some is also available on GitHub
- GitHub: I'll be maintaining a repo with notebooks and other materials for the course, but use this only if it is convenient for you.  Moodle will be the authoritative source.
- more may be added as we go 

For your labs and learning I suggest that you use Jupyter notebooks, either on a GlasgowAnywhere machine or on your own machine.  You can use IDLE if you would like to, but we won't be able to support you in installing the packages we'll need on your own machine for IDLE.


## The weekly schedule:
We have scheduled lecture sessions online for an hour at noon on Wednesday and Friday, and you should have a lab slot assigned to you on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.  The exact schedule of what happens when will vary a little week-to-week, but in general the plan is:

By Wednesday afternoon: 
- I will release any materials or pre-recorded videos about new material for the cycle including the lecture notes and lab (where possible I may release these earlier, but don't feel pressure to engage with them in the previous cycle if you're not ready)

You should work through the material and then work on your weekly lab sometime between when they are released and when your next lab/tutorial session is. 

Monday to Wednesday morning:
- You will discuss your progress on your weekly lab assignment at your lab/tutorial sessions.  Quizzes on this material will be open all week.  

On Wednesday at noon:
- we will have a live (but recorded) session where we talk about questions that have come up over the cycle, or run through examples of things people found difficult in the labs.  

I'm not planning to use the Friday at noon slot for a live lecture because I'll be pre-recording the content.  Most students last your reported finding shorter videos for new content easier to digest than hour-long live (and then recorded) lectures.  If a majority of students would rather have a single live Friday session for new material instead of the videos, I'll consider switching partway through the course.  If you want this let your student rep know, or tell me directly and I'll run a poll.  

Near the end of the course when you are spending most of your time working on your assessed assignment and revision, this schedule will change as we won't have as much new material.
