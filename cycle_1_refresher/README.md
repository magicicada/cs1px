# Cycle 1

Cycle 1 is about familiarising you with the tools you need for CS1PX, and refreshing some of the skills from your previous learning (most likely in CS1CT) that you will be using: lists, dictionaries, tuples, functions, and control structures.

Todo this cycle:
- Get set up with the tools for the course, and read over what we will do and how it will work
- Attend lectures and work through notes if needed
- Work on lab exercises
- Complete quiz online
