# Cycle 2

In Cycle 2 we'll be talking more about planning structures for storing data with associated functions for dealing with those data, and using a Python library to plot the data that we store.

We'll return to the idea of a set of data with associated functions again later in the course, and you'll see it again in further CS study - particularly as 'objects' in object-oriented programming.
