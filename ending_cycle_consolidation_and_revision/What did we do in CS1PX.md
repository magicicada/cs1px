# What did we do in CS1PX?

In this document we'll remind ourselves what we've covered in CS1PX, and what I really want you to have learned. In another document and video (to be released later), we'll have a look at some sample types of exam questions to help you in your revision.  

So let's have a look at what we covered in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Refresher
    - General basic programming in Python
    - Focussed on dictionaries, lists, tuples and operating on these
- Cycle 2: Fancy functions
    - Recursive functions
    - Higher-order functions
- Cycle 3: Errors and exceptions
    - Defensive programming
    - Catching exceptions in Python using `try/except/finally`
- Cycle 4: Data structures and plotting
    - Loading and storing data in structures we design
    - Reading data from files
    - plotting using `matplotlib`
- Cycle 5: Complexity
    - Big-O runtime complexity
    - How to recognise the big-O complexity of a piece of code
    - How to recognise a plot of a big-O complexity
    - How to combine complexities when combining pieces of code
- Cycle 6: Searching
    - Simple search
    - Binary search
        - Iterative
        - Recursive
    - Complexities of both, and when we can use each
- Cycle 7: Sorting
    - Selection sort (recursive and iterative)
    - Bubble sort
    - Odd-even sort
- Cycle 8: Sorting with a custom data structure
    - Looked at reading/storing data again
    - Defining a custom less-than or greater-than function
    - Using those custom structures in a sorting function
