Cycle 2 is about what I'm calling 'fancy functions' - for us in CS1PX, that means higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments and recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves.

These two topics are ones that students often find challenging at first, so be patient with yourself! I will explain these things in recorded videos, but will also include links to other explanations for recursion that you may find helpful. Do not feel pressure to watch the extra videos if you do not feel that they will help you, or if you are already understanding recursion well.

Todo for this cycle:

- Watch recorded videos for Cycle 2
   -(Only if you feel it will help you) watch extra other explanations of recursion
- Work on lab exercises
- Discuss progress on lab week of January 24
- Quiz online week of January 24

A few extra videos on recursion:
- [Craig Kaplan explaining recursion using a 'Parable of the clones' on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al15GtRxmRE)
- [A computerphile video on recursion on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc) Though be careful - the code examples here are not in Python!
